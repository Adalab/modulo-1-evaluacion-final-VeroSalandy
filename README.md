# Final excercise review of module 1

The final test of module 1 consists of developing a webpage from zero, using the design that we got provided. The webpage should include the following concepts: Sass, flexbox and CSS Grid, media queries and optional: resolving interactions using transitions.
For the development of the webpage we got the 'Adalab web starter kit' provided, which we needed to use.

## What is the 'Adalab web starter kit'

The 'Adalab web starter kit' uses Node and is a project template which has pre-installed and pre-configured functionalities, such as HTML templates, SASS preprocessor and a local server.
_side note: in order to be able to use the 'Adalab web starter kit' it is necessary to have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) instaled._

## How to install and start the project:

In order to be able to start the project in a local server it is important to first create your own repository and then install npm. For this we need to open our project folder in vs-code (in our project-folder we need to have copied the all the content of the Adalab web starter kit), then we need to open a terminal in our project-folder and run the command 'npm install'. This may take a few minutes and after npm is installed, we can start our project on a local server with the command 'npm start'.
_side note: it is important to always commit and push our changes/modifications using git --> git add -A --> git commit -m "example: modified main section" --> git push_

## How to publish the project on GitHub Pages:

When our project is fineshed and we have our final version, we need to produce/generate our production webpage. We do that by running the command 'npm run docs'. After this we need to upload to our repository our 'docs/'-folder that just got generated. Then we go to the 'settings'-tab of our repository and go to the 'GitHub Pages"-section, there we need to activate the option **master branch /docs folder**
